## Solana Foundation Delegation Program

The Solana Foundation offers the SFDP that will match 1:1 the stake from the Authorized Withdrawer account. In our case, this account will be under the purview of Michel/Mises Capital.

The critical requirement from the SFDP is to keep a Testnet meeting specific performance criteria. Details [here](https://solana.org/delegation-criteria).
