# Stake Pools

There are multiple stake pools in Solana, with the largest ones being JitoSOL, mSOL and BlazeSOL. They offer transparent ways to compete for their delegated stake and have clear parameters we need to match.

Stake Pools work by acting as middle men between direct stakers and validators. They collect stake from direct stakers and distribute that stake to a set of validators they select based on their performance criteria, and charge a fee for this service to the stakers.
